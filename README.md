Following technologies were used in order to create this ecommerce website.
* NodeJS
* MongoDB
* All the dependency packages in order to run the project
* Bootstrap
* Jquery
* Jade
* NPM

Steps to run the app
=====================
* After cloning the repo, install the dependencies by running **npm install**
* To start the server, run **npm start** on the base directory.
